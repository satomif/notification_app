# Notification App

This is an agent notification app.

It has two goals:

1. demonstrating a possible usage of the `notify` endpoint of ZAM,
2. broadcasting messages to signed-in agents.

Only administrators can broadcast messages. They can send them to everybody, or
just target a few groups.

The messages can use a restricted subset of Markdown:

* links
* images
* bold
* italic
* level 3 header

Also, URLs are detected and automatically turned either into a link or an image.
